# Affiliate URLs

Affilate URLs is a complete URL management system for WordPress that allows you create, manage, and track outbound links from your site. Additionally Affiliate URLs allows you to override your redirects with PPC tracking software tracking URLs, a feature of iMobiTrax.

## Description

Affiliate URLs is a complete URL management system that allows you create, manage, and track outbound links from your site by using custom post types and 301 redirects.

It adds a new custom post type to your Admin menu, where you can create, edit, delete, and manage URLs. It stores click counts in the form of a custom field on that custom post type, so it scales really well.

And by avoiding page based redirects, which is the current trend in masking affiliate links, we avoid any issues with permalink conflicts, and therefore avoid any performance issues.

Affiliate URLs also allows you to override your redirects with PPC tracking software tracking URLs, a feature of iMobiTrax.
